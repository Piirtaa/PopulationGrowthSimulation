# PopulationGrowthSimulation
A month-by-month simulation of population growth given a few parameters.  Warning:  this is not performant!  Try not to model more than a couple hundred years!

The impetus for this was answering the question:  given a population of 1000 people, they started having kids at 15 and had only 5 kids max, how long would it take to come to the current population.
